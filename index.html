        <h2>The Assignment</h2>
        <p>In August of 2024, I was tasked with developing an adventure game on GitHub using Python that could be played entirely in the terminal for my web development class. We were given the choice to work in groups or by ourselves, and I chose to work alone. The game needed NPCs that had dialogue, two items with different functionalities, a puzzle, and we were required to use classes in our code. It took me a while to come up with an idea, but I eventually decided to make mine a story focused game since I enjoy writing stories and characters.</p>
